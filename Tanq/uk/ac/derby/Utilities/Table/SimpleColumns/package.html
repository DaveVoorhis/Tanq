SimpleTable - Mechanisms to quickly construct a table from column definitions.

<p>Mechanisms are provided to quickly define JTable columns by consolidating 
the separate TableModel, TableCellRenderer, and TableCellEditor mechanisms into 
a single ColumnDefinition class.

<p>It is assumed that the JTable will be working from a collection of
Objects, one per table row.
